I am a first year Mathematics Ph.D. student at [Brown university](https://www.brown.edu/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/).

My research interest lies in Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory.
