In the presentation, I reproduced the proof of Riemann-Roch Theorem in the case $ùë∑^1$ by constructing a basis of a certain vector space. Besides, I applied Riemann-Roch Theorem to show the equivalence of having genus 0 and being isomorphic to $ùë∑^1$ for any smooth curve over algebraically closed field $k$.
